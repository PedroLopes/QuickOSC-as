# QuickOSC app for Android <sup>TM</sup>

Simple Dirty Quick OSC App

You probably already know what [OSC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Sound_Control "link") is. Here is a very simple, dirty and quick OSC application which lets you modify OSC messages on your phone/tablet.

I used JavaOSC by [Illposed Software](http://www.illposed.com/software/javaosc.html "link").

This is the Android Studio version of the earlier Eclipse project I used to work on. The other [repository](https://github.com/artsince/QuickOSC) is likely to be discontinued.

There is a more advanced OSC project I have been working on called [AndrOSC](https://github.com/artsince/AndrOSC). You can also check that one out if you are interested.

## Dependencies
+ JavaOSC: handles OSC messaging methods
+ donations: a custom module to handle in-app products
+ com.android.support:support-v4: the support library to handle backwards compatibility with DialogFragments.

## Distribution
The app can be downloaded on the [Google Play Market](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ahmetkizilay.controls.osc "Link").
